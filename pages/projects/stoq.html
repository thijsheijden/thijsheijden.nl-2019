        <h1>STOQ</h1>
        <p>Stoq is a real time prediction app which predicts trends for almost 500 stocks in the S&P 500. Predictions are made using a recurrent neural network built using Tensorflow and the app itself was made using Swift 4.<br><br>
        Stoq has subtle animations incorporated throughout the app and has a dedicated light and dark theme. Built entirely in the Model-View-Presenter architecture.</p>
