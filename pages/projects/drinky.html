    <h1>DRINKY</h1>
    <p>Drinky is an app which helps you stay hydrated. I built this because I felt like I often go too long without drinking anything, especially when coding or working on assignments. I wanted an application which looked good and had good support for the Health
     app. None of the ones I tried had this, so I decided to build my own.<br><br>The entire app is built in Swift 4.2 and uses frameworks like UIKit, HealthKit and CoreData. Drinky sends you notifications when it feels like you're slacking on the amount
        of water you should be drinking. Drinky adds all the water you drink to the Health app which gives you a good current and historical overview of your habits.</p>
